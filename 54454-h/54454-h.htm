<p>Some portions of the following pages have already
appeared in the monthly numbers of the <cite>Sanitary
Engineer</cite>, and the complete work is now published
with a view to assist Surveyors of Towns and
others who are directly engaged in providing that
house dustbins shall be regularly cleared, and
streets kept clean; and also in the hope that it may
be the means of drawing some public attention to the
question, thus showing the householder something of
what is being done for his welfare by Sanitary Authorities,
and how each individual may assist in the good
work, instead of, as is now frequently the case,
inadvertently or purposely retarding the execution of
some very necessary though unostentatious sanitary
measures. I am not aware that any book, or even
pamphlet, has yet been written on this subject, and
I venture to believe that in these pages there may be
found something to interest all readers.</p>

"SCAVENGING."</h2>


<p>The word "Scavenging," or "Scavengering," as
it is frequently styled, is a very comprehensive term,
as it includes that of house scavenging or the
removal of house refuse, and also that of street
scavenging, or the sweeping and cleansing of streets,
and the carting away of all such materials removed
from their surface. In dealing with this subject it
will be necessary to consider the following heads,
viz.:&mdash;(1) What is house refuse, (2) How and in what
manner shall it be temporarily stored pending the
visit of the Scavenger, (3) What are the best methods
for its collection, (4) In what manner shall it be
eventually disposed of, and (5) the cost of the whole
work; (6) Which are the best methods for sweeping
and cleansing streets, (7) Whether machinery is more
economical than hand labour, (8) The extra work
involved by the ill construction of streets and the
materials of which they are formed, (9) Whether
private courts and alleys not repairable by the
Sanitary Authority should be swept and cleansed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
them, (10) The ultimate disposal of excessive accumulations
of mud, (11) The removal and disposal
of snow, (12) The watering of streets, and (13) The
cost of all such work.</p>

<p>The Public Health Act of 1875 contains several
clauses bearing on the subject of scavenging and the
cleansing of streets, and sec. 42, part III., enacts as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Every local authority may, and when required
by order of the Local Government Board shall,
themselves undertake or contract for&mdash;</p>

<p>"The removal of house refuse from premises;</p>

<p>"The cleansing of earth closets, privies, ashpits,
and cesspools; either for the whole or any part of
their district.</p>

<p>"Moreover, every urban authority and rural
authority invested by the Local Government Board
with the requisite powers may, and when required
by order of the said Board shall, themselves undertake
or contract for the proper watering of streets
for the whole or any part of their district.</p>

<p>"All matters collected by the local authority or
contractor in pursuance of this section may be
sold or otherwise disposed of, and any profits thus
made by an urban authority shall be carried to the
account of the fund or rate applicable by them for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
the general purposes of this Act; and any profits
thus made by a rural authority in respect of any
contributory place shall be carried to the account
of the fund or rate out of which expenses incurred
under this section by that authority in such contributory
place are defrayed.</p>

<p>"If any person removes or obstructs the local
authority or contractor in removing any matters by
this section authorised to be removed by the local
authority he shall for each offence be liable to a
penalty not exceeding <em>five pounds</em>: provided that
the occupier of a house within the district shall not
be liable to such penalty in respect of any such
matters which are produced on his own premises
and are intended to be removed for sale or for his
own use and are in the meantime kept so as not to
be a nuisance."</p>

<p>Section 45 also enacts that "any urban authority
may, if they see fit, provide in proper and convenient
situations receptacles for the temporary deposit
and collection of dust, ashes, and rubbish; they
may also provide fit buildings and places for the
deposit of any matters collected by them in pursuance
of this part of this Act."</p>

<p>The Act also gives the power to local authorities to
make bye-laws with respect to the cleansing of footpaths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
and pavements, the removal of house refuse
and the cleansing of earth closets, privies, ashpits,
and cesspools, and the prevention of nuisances
arising from snow, filth, dust, ashes, and refuse.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that the Legislature find it
necessary to frame laws for the proper execution of
scavenging by every local authority, and we shall see
in the following chapters how further clauses in the
Public Health Act, as well as in many private
Improvement Acts and also in Bye-laws, detail the
manner in which this work ought to be properly
carried out. I shall further endeavour to show where
errors in the working now exist, and give some
suggestions that would, in my opinion, be, if carried
out, improvements upon the present systems.</p>

HOUSE REFUSE.</h2>


<p>Now the first question that presents itself to us is:
what is house refuse? and how is it to be defined?
for unless this point is satisfactorily settled, great
onus and expense will be put on the local authority if
they are to be compelled to remove all trade, garden,
and other refuse in addition to what may be legally
entitled house refuse.</p>

<p>Section 4, part I., Public Health Act, 1875,
contains the following definition of the word house:
"House" includes schools, also factories and other
buildings in which more than twenty persons are
employed at one time. But all that is apparently
said in reference to the definition of refuse is to be
found in "Glenn's Public Health Act," 1875, where
in a foot note to section 44, part III. of the before
named Act, is the negative argument "what is not
refuse:" and describes one or two cases in which it
was held that certain ashes from furnaces, etc., were
to be designated as "trade refuse," and further says
"that the intention of the Act was that only the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
rubbish arising from the domestic use of houses
should be removed."</p>

<p>On reference, however, to some local Improvement
Acts, it appears that the definition is given more in
detail, for we find that house refuse is there described
as "all dirt, dust, dung, offal, cinders, ashes, rubbish,
filth, and soil."</p>

<p>We may thus, we imagine, be fairly content with
these definitions, and may assume that all house
refuse legally so designated, and which it is the duty
of the scavenger to remove, is really so removed by
the direction of the local authority without dispute,
but that the following articles, which frequently find
their way into a domestic dustbin, are not in the
strict terms of the Act expected to be removed by the
scavenger, viz., (1) plaster from walls and brick bats,
(2) large quantities of broken bottles and flower pots,
(3) clinkers and ashes from foundries and greenhouses,
(4) wall papers torn from the rooms of a
house, (5) scrap tin (but not old tins which have
contained tinned meats and which, although very
objectionable and bulky, may be fairly assumed to be
house refuse), and (6) all garden refuse such as grass
cuttings, dead leaves, and the loppings from trees
and shrubs. The Bromley Local Board issue a card
on which is printed, amongst other information with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
reference to the contract for the removal of house
refuse, the following:&mdash;"It is hoped that householders
will as far as possible facilitate the
systematic removal of refuse by providing suitable
dustbins, and directing their servants that ordinary
house refuse only shall be deposited in such receptacles.
The following are some of the items
of refuse which the contractors are bound to
remove, viz.:&mdash;cinder ashes, potatoe peelings,
cabbage leaves, and kitchen refuse generally. But
the contractors are not required to remove the
refuse of any trade, manufacture, or business, or
of any building materials or any garden cuttings or
sweepings." Some valuable statistics have recently
been prepared by me from answers obtained from
upwards of ninety of the principal cities, and towns
in England, in reply to a series of questions which
I addressed to the local surveyors on the subject of
scavenging, and on referring to these statistics it is
found that out of these ninety towns, the authorities
of only thirteen of them direct the removal of both
trade and garden refuse without any special extra
payment being made by the householder, but that
this is only done when these materials are placed in
the ordinary dustbin or <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'ash pit attached'">ashpit attached</ins> to a house.
Several towns, however, it appears remove such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
materials on special payments being made of sums
varying from 1s. 6d. to 3s. per load.</p>

<p>Disputes frequently arise between the men employed
in scavenging and the householder on these vexed
questions as to the difference between house, trade, or
garden refuse, a dispute often raised by the scavengers
themselves, in the hope of obtaining a gratuity or
reward for the clearance of a dustbin which no doubt,
legally, they are perfectly justified in refusing to
empty, and in order to lessen the chance of such
disputes and to attempt to settle this question the
following suggestions may be of value.</p>

<p>It would no doubt be vexatious if any sanitary
authority were to absolutely refuse to remove the
"garden" refuse from those houses to which a small
flower garden was attached, whilst it would on the
contrary be an unfair tax upon the general community
if the refuse of large gardens was removed
without payment. A good rule would therefore be to
remove only such <em>garden</em> refuse as was contained in
the ordinary dustbin or ashpit attached to a house,
and that as the removal of any kind of <em>trade</em> refuse
would no doubt lead to abuses if done gratuitously
by the sanitary authority, that this material should
only be removed on payment of some sum, which
should be previously fixed by the Local Authority,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
and each case should be reported to the officer
superintending the work before it was removed.</p>

<p>There are, of course, in addition to the ordinary
house refuse the waste materials from the surface of
the streets, and from markets and slaughter-houses,
which have to be collected and disposed of by the
Local Authority, but these materials should be
collected in a special manner, independently of the
ordinary removal of the house refuse.</p>

<span class="lsp2">THE DUSTBIN.</span></h2>


<p>The next question that we have to consider, having
thus far discussed the subject of "what is house
refuse," is the important one of the manner and
place in which it shall be temporarily stored pending
the visit of the scavenger. I will begin as I did in
the former case by turning to the law on the subject,
and find out if it can help us.</p>

<p>Section 40, part III., of the Public Health Act of
1875 enacts that: "Every local authority shall
provide that all drains, water-closets, earth-closets,
privies, <em>ashpits</em>, and cesspools within their district
be constructed and kept so as not to be a nuisance
or injurious to health."</p>

<p>And section 35 of the above Act states, "It shall
not be lawful newly to erect any house or to rebuild
any house pulled down to or below the ground floor
without a sufficient water-closet, earth-closet, or
privy, and an ashpit furnished with proper doors
and coverings. Any person who causes any house
to be erected or rebuilt in contravention of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
enactment shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding
twenty pounds."</p>

<p>The Act also gives power to local authorities to
enforce provision of ashpit accommodation for houses
where such accommodation does not already exist,
and to frame bye-laws with respect to ashpits.</p>

<p>In the year 1877 the Local Government Board
issued a series of model bye-laws for the use of
sanitary authorities, and No. IV. of this series,
which is upon "New Streets and Buildings," contains
the following six lengthy clauses, regulating the
position of an ashpit with reference to a dwelling-house
or public-building, or to any water supply, and
for the purpose of removing its contents without
carrying them through any dwelling-house, &amp;c.:&mdash;</p>

<p>"80. Every person who shall construct an ashpit
in connection with a building shall construct such
ashpit at a distance of <em>six feet</em> at the least from a
dwelling-house or public building, or any building
in which any person may be, or may be intended
to be employed in any manufacture, trade, or
business.</p>

<p>"81. A person who shall construct an ashpit in
connexion with a building shall not construct such
ashpit within the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'distance of   '">distance of __</ins> <em>feet</em> from any water
supplied for use, or used or likely to be used by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
man for drinking or domestic purposes, or for
manufacturing drinks for the use of man, or otherwise
in such a position as to endanger the pollution
of any such water.</p>

<p>"82. Every person who shall construct an ashpit
in connexion with a building shall construct such
ashpit in such a manner and in such a position as
to afford ready means of access to such ashpit for
the purpose of cleansing such ashpit, and of
removing the contents thereof, and, so far as may
be practicable, in such a manner and in such a
position as to admit of the contents of such ashpit
being removed therefrom, and from the premises to
which such ashpit may belong, without being
carried through any dwelling-house or public
building, or any building in which any person may
be, or may be intended to be employed in any
manufacture, trade, or business.</p>

<p>"83. Every person who shall construct an ashpit
in connection with a building shall construct such
ashpit of a capacity not exceeding in any case <em>six
cubic feet</em>, or of such less capacity as may be sufficient
to contain all dust, ashes, rubbish, and dry
refuse which may accumulate during a period not
exceeding <em>one week</em> upon the premises to which
such ashpit may belong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>"84. Every person who shall construct an ashpit
in connection with a building shall construct such
ashpit of flagging, or of slate, or of good brickwork,
at least <em>nine inches</em> thick, and rendered inside with
good cement or properly asphalted.</p>

<p>"He shall construct such ashpit so that the floor
thereof shall be at a height of not less than <em>three
inches</em> above the surface of the ground adjoining
such ashpit, and he shall cause such floor to be
properly flagged or asphalted.</p>

<p>"He shall cause such ashpit to be properly roofed
over and ventilated, and to be furnished with a
suitable door in such a position and so constructed
and fitted as to admit of the convenient removal
of the contents of such ashpit, and to admit of
being securely closed and fastened for the effectual
prevention of the escape of any of the contents of
such ashpit.</p>

<p>"85. A person who shall construct an ashpit in
connexion with a building shall not cause or suffer
any part of such ashpit to communicate with any
drain."</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the position of the
dustbin or ashpit, as regards its site with reference
to the main dwelling-house, is of primary sanitary
importance, for if the garbage and domestic accumu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>lations
therein are allowed to remain for a few days,
especially when the weather is close, damp, and
warm, they become very offensive, and the emanations
therefrom may even be highly deleterious and
dangerous to health; this effect is aggravated by
persons emptying vegetable refuse and other matters
which are <em>wet</em> into the dustbin, as decomposition of
these matters is greatly assisted by this addition, and
it would be well that all such matters should be
burnt on the kitchen or scullery fire along with a
large percentage of the ashes which could be sifted
and saved from those which too readily find their
way into the dustbin, and are thus wasted. Care
would of course have to be taken in this process that
no smell or nuisance was caused by burning this
refuse, but the greatest difficulty would arise in overcoming
the time-honoured prejudices of the domestic
servant who usually finds the dustbin or ashpit the
most convenient and least troublesome place to
dispose of nearly everything that to her may be
entitled rubbish.</p>

<p>Now with all due respect to those who framed
Section 35 of the Public Health Act of 1875, it is
open to considerable doubt whether the <em>fixed</em> dustbin
or ashpit, as it is there styled, is the best and most
sanitary receptacle for the house refuse. They may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
be necessary and suitable for Public Institutions, or
for large isolated private dwellings, or for schools or
any places where excessive quantities of refuse may
accumulate, but where this refuse is systematically
and properly removed by the order of the local
authority, at such times and in such manner as will
be hereafter pointed out, a movable or portable dustbin,
box, or basket, is far preferable to the large
immoveable inconvenient fixed ashpit, recommended
and enforced under the Act.</p>

<p>This portable dustbox should be of such dimensions
that the men employed in removing the refuse could
easily carry it out and empty its contents into the
cart, and there is nothing to prevent more than one
being provided, if it is found insufficient for the
requirements of the household. The box should be
made of iron, or wood or basket lined with tin, or
some equally impervious material, so that it can
easily be washed out and thoroughly cleansed and
disinfected when found necessary to do so, a matter
very difficult to accomplish with the fixed ashpit.
The <em>whole</em> of its contents could be quickly emptied,
which is more than can be easily effected with the
fixed ashpit, and then only when very special arrangements
are made for its drainage. The movable
dustbox can, in addition to these advantages, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
placed in any part of the premises, and may be
covered or not as may be deemed desirable, and need
not, like many of the existing ashpits, be fixed in
such a position as to appear to have been thus
placed for the express purpose of poisoning with its
foul smell the whole of the inhabitants in its vicinity.
The movable box can also be readily taken out to
the scavenging cart by the householder himself, a
very essential requisite, as will be shown in the next
chapter.</p>

THE COLLECTION OF HOUSE REFUSE.</h2>


<p>The collection of house refuse should be done
satisfactorily, expeditiously, and economically.</p>

<p>At the present time there seem to be only three
methods by which this is attempted to be effected;
they are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1.) By a house to house call at intermittent
periods.</p>

<p>(2.) By the scavengers giving notice of their
approach by ringing a bell or by other signal, and
requiring the householder to bring out the refuse to
the cart, and</p>

<p>(3.) By placing public dustbins in different localities,
and expecting householders in their vicinity to
place the house refuse in these dustbins, which would
then be cleared from time to time by the local
authority.</p>

<p>The law is silent on the subject of what may be
considered as an efficient collection and removal of
house refuse, and experience only can teach us the
best manner of thoroughly effecting this work without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
losing sight of the economical side of the question;
but it appears, on again referring to the table of
statistics which have been previously mentioned, that
nearly all the towns adopt the two first methods
mentioned above for the removal of the house refuse,
but that very few of them are able to adopt any
public dustbins or "lay stall" accommodation for
the temporary reception of the refuse, not only on
account of their first cost, but also from the difficulty
of finding suitable positions for them. This latter
objection to the adoption of public dustbins arises in
great measure from the fact that they are usually
constructed of galvanised iron in the form of open
boxes or troughs, which are readily accessible to
young children and poultry, who often scatter their
contents in every direction, and they are also
generally open to the view of the inhabitants of the
courts, and to passers by, whose "morale" it is
found is certainly not improved by constant familiarity
with the sight of filth.</p>

<p>If these dustbins were constructed with properly
balanced self-closing lids, these objections would be
overcome, and their first cost would be but trifling
when compared with the benefit to be derived by
placing them in some of the thickly populated courts
and alleys which are unfortunately to be found in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
nearly every town. Where there are no public dustbins
the inhabitants of these courts throw their waste
products upon the surface of the streets or courts,
from time to time throughout the day, as it cannot
be expected nor desired that such materials should
remain, even for twenty-four hours, in their one living
room, which is frequently over crowded, and has but
little spare space even for the common necessities of
life; but that these waste products should be thus
strewn over the surface of the street or court is
almost equally objectionable, and points to the
enormous advantage to be gained by placing in convenient
situations the covered dustbins that are
described above, the contents of which could be
easily emptied once a day.</p>

<p>The greatest difficulty would be found to be that of
inducing the inhabitants to take the trouble to carry
their house refuse to the dustbin, but they might be
gradually educated up to this standard of cleanliness,
and a few persons judiciously summoned and punished
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">"pour encourager les autres,"</span> when detected in
throwing any of their waste products on to the
surface of the street or court, would no doubt have a
very beneficial effect in assisting their education.</p>

<p>With reference to the question of a house to house
call or visitation by the scavengers for the purpose of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
removing the refuse. This is no doubt the method
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">"par excellence"</span> of all the systems for its effectual
removal without much trouble to the householder,
but except in suburban districts and for the collection
of refuse from the better class of dwelling-houses and
public institutions, the expense, delay, and difficulty
which would be incurred in calling at every house
throughout a town, would make it almost impracticable,
and consequently this system is universally
combined with that which is known as the bell or
signal system, which simply means that the scavenging
cart in going its rounds has a bell attached to it,
or the horse, which bell rings automatically as the
cart proceeds on its way; or the man in charge
blows a trumpet, or calls in stentorian tones,
"Dust oh!" On hearing this signal, <em>but not before</em>,
the householder is expected to bring out the refuse in
some convenient receptacle, which is then emptied
into the cart by the scavenger.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the receptacles containing all
the waste products of these householders are brought
out and are placed in the gutter of the street close to
the kerb, long before the cart makes its appearance
or can be reasonably expected to do so.</p>

<p>These temporary receptacles are, as may be easily
imagined of various sizes and shapes, and are com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>posed
of various materials. On one side you may
see a well and suitably constructed galvanized iron
box, with handles and cover complete, on the other
an old band box, cigar box, or tin saucepan.</p>

<p>The result of these inappropriate receptacles filled
with heterogeneous collections of house refuse being
left unprotected in the public streets, is that their
contents are quickly strewn about the surface of the
street, either by their being upset accidentally, or
purposely, by persons who gain a precarious livelihood
by abstracting therefrom, and selling rags,
bones, and similar articles, or by the dogs, ever on
the alert for a hasty and disgusting meal, and the
appearance of the street which has probably been
carefully swept and garnished during the night or
early in the morning, quickly assumes, especially in
a high wind, a very offensive character, and probably
has to be entirely re-swept and cleansed before the
ordinary traffic of the day commences.</p>

<p>To obviate these evils arising from this practice
almost universally adopted, I suggest the following
plan:&mdash;</p>

<p>A specially designed frame or carriage must be
constructed somewhat similar in appearance to a
timber waggon; this must be furnished with a
number of strong iron hooks, with or without simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
lifting gear, according to the strength and sizes of
the receptacles hereafter described. Upon these
hooks are to be hung cylindrical shaped galvanized
iron boxes with balanced covers, and hopper-shaped
mouths, and of such cubical capacity as may be
found to meet the requirements of any district
choosing to adopt my system. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</i>
would be as follows:&mdash;The waggon should be drawn
through certain selected streets at about 6.30 a.m.;
the boxes or cylinders unhung from it, and placed in
such suitable and convenient positions as may be
found necessary; their distance apart may be about
that of the ordinary street lamp posts, and their
position may be in the street channel gutter close to
the kerb of the footpath; they should be allowed to
remain about a couple of hours, during which time
the householders in the vicinity of the boxes would
be expected to empty into them all the sweepings,
garbage, and house refuse from their premises; at
the end of this time the waggon would again appear,
and the boxes or cylinders would be attached to the
hooks, and be taken to the nearest refuse depôt.</p>

<p>There are many advantages to be gained by adopting
my proposed system, the principal one being that of
preventing the disgusting practice of allowing the
foul refuse from houses, to be openly displayed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
public streets, in the manner previously described,
and in preventing the possibility of such refuse
being allowed to stay for a single instant upon the
surface of the street, where even if it is afterwards
carefully removed, an ugly stain is almost sure to
remain for many hours afterwards.</p>

<p>Another advantage would be the great convenience
to householders of that of having a ready receptacle
for their refuse, only a few yards at the most from
their doors.</p>

<p>The saving of time also in the collection would be
considerable, as the scavengers need not wait one
single moment beyond the time required to attach
the cylinder to the waggon, and there is in addition
the cleanliness with which this operation could be
performed, thus conferring a great boon on the foot
passengers in the streets, who, under the present
system, are often half smothered by the dust when
the scavengers are engaged in emptying the contents
of the usual inappropriate receptacles into the
ordinary dust cart.</p>

<p>The facilities also for cleansing or disinfecting the
cylinders would be undoubted, and the economy, not
only in time but in actual expense over the existing
system, would be considerable, for the cylinders
would last a long time without repairs being needed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
not so the ordinary dust cart, which speedily wears
out, principally from the fact that the "tipping"
necessary to empty it of its contents, is highly detrimental
to its stability.</p>

<p>Having thus shown a method by which the collection
of house refuse in crowded streets, where a
house-to-house visit is impracticable, can be materially
improved, I will pass on to the present system
of the collection of refuse in the suburban and rural
districts of a town by a house-to-house call.</p>

<p>A great improvement in this system would no
doubt be effected by adopting the movable dust
boxes I suggest in the chapter on "The Dustbin," as
great delay and consequent expense would be saved
thereby, and the work would be altogether more
effectually and properly performed, but it is also
found that very frequently the scavengers on calling
at a house for the purpose of removing the accumulated
refuse, are told by the servant that they cannot
be admitted, either because it is an inconvenient
hour, or that it is washing day, or that being a wet
day the scavengers' boots are too dirty to walk over
their clean passages or floor, or that the dustbin is
not full, and that they must call another day, or
some other equally plausible excuse, so that the visit
is a useless one, and time is lost. Another evil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
arising out of this is also the fact that as the
scavenger's cart has usually a regular round, a
fruitless visit as described, results in the dustbin
remaining uncleared for perhaps another week, or
even more, a state of things not at all to be desired.</p>

<p>In order to assist in obviating the chances of such
useless visits by the scavengers, I would suggest a
very simple remedy, which has already been tried in
some towns with considerable success. It consists in
the householder placing a card bearing the letter D,
or some other distinguishing mark, in a conspicuous
place in a window, when the services of the scavengers
are required; these cards should be printed and
circulated by the Sanitary Authority of the district,
who should state on the back of the card the days on
which the scavengers would visit each neighbourhood,
with the approximate hour of the day in which they
would appear, in each road or street if practicable, in
order that the householder may not be unnecessarily
inconvenienced by being obliged to keep the card for
any length of time in his window.</p>

<p>The scavengers in passing, observe the signal, and
call at the house, otherwise they pass on, unless
specially called in by the occupants, thus avoiding
any unnecessary delay in their rounds.</p>

<p>A visit from the scavengers either before seven or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
after ten in the morning is generally very inconvenient
for households of a superior class, and should
be, if possible, carefully avoided by the Sanitary
Authority.</p>

THE SCAVENGER'S CART.</h2>


<p>The next question that presents itself to our notice
is that of the form, style, and construction of the
cart usually employed in this work of house refuse
collection, and whether it is well suited for the
requirements of the work or otherwise.</p>

<p>The cart usually employed is that known as the
ordinary "tip cart," strongly, if not clumsily, constructed
of an oak frame, with elm or deal sides of
considerable height; it holds about a couple of cubic
yards of materials, and generally costs from sixteen
to twenty pounds.</p>

<p>These carts are not only clumsy and heavy, but
they give an overweighted diminutive appearance to
the horse between the shafts, especially as the quality
of horse employed for work of this character is frequently
none of the best, and as a matter of fact the
cart is so ill-balanced that the bulk of its weight is
thrown upon the back of the horse. The height, too,
of the cart is often so great as to necessitate the use
of a short ladder, up which the scavenger has to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
climb, before he can discharge the contents of his
basket into the cart, sending in the process a shower
of offensive dust in every direction, far from pleasant
for those unfortunate persons who happen to be
passing near the spot at the time. When used as
"slop" carts the same objections arise, as in this
case the liquid mud is splashed in every direction,
owing to the height to which it has to be thrown by
the shovel of the scavenger.</p>

<p>Some difficulty is also experienced in thoroughly
covering over the contents of the cart, so that not
only shall it be hidden from the eye, but that it shall
prevent either the liquid mud from being spilled on
the ground, or if the cart is being used to convey
either dust or house refuse, to prevent the contents
being blown about, or dropped upon the surface of
the street.</p>

<p>The imperfect mode at present adopted is to cover
the cart with a tarpaulin, which is tied down as
tightly as the circumstances of the case will admit,
but which as a rule does not effectually answer the
purpose for which it is intended. In towns where
the house refuse is not collected separately from the
road scrapings, a judicious mixture of the two in the
cart considerably assists in preventing any mud
slopping or dust blowing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>The material being wood of which these carts are
constructed, it becomes a difficult matter either to
effectually cleanse them after use, or to properly
disinfect them, which in times of any serious outbreak
of an epidemic is essential to the sanitary well-being
of a community. The employment also of
wooden carts for this work is bad economy, their
rough usage, and the mode adopted for emptying
them by "tipping," rendering their life but a short
one, a cart in constant work frequently costing from
four to five pounds per annum in repairs, and having
but very little of the original material of which it
was constructed left in it at the end of six years.</p>

<p>With a view to obviate these and other objections,
several improved carts and waggons have been introduced
by different makers, who have styled them by
a variety of names, in order to recommend them to
the notice of the public. Amongst other names they
are called dust carts, general purpose carts, sanitary
carts, slush carts, tumbler carts, mud waggons, tip
waggons, slop waggons, &amp;c.</p>

<p>They are generally constructed with iron bodies
fixed upon wooden frames on wheels; they are of
various forms and designs, the principal objects
aimed at being lightness of construction combined
with strength, so balanced as to bear with a minimum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of weight upon the horse; economy in their cost has
not been lost sight of, and they are usually provided
with some special means for emptying, either by
being completely inverted by a chain and windlass,
or by some mechanical arrangement of the tailboard;
they are built very low upon their axles, so as to be
easily filled, are either completely covered over with
a moveable lid, or are fitted with hinged side boards,
so as to prevent any splashing over of their contents,
and as they are nearly all constructed with iron, they
are easily cleansed and disinfected whenever it is
thought necessary to do so.</p>

<p>Amongst others I may mention the following firms
who have made the construction of these sanitary
carts and waggons <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'a specialite'">a speciality</ins>:&mdash;Messrs. Bayley
&amp; Co., Newington Causeway, London; Messrs.
Cocksedge &amp; Co., of Stowmarket; the Bristol Waggon
Works Company; and Messrs. Smith &amp; Son, of
Barnard Castle, Yorkshire.</p>

DISPOSAL OF HOUSE REFUSE.</h2>


<p>Having proceeded thus far with my subject, the
very important question next arises as to the manner
of the disposal of the house refuse after it has been
collected by the Local Authority, both with regard to
its sanitary aspect and also to that of economy.</p>

<p>So much depends upon the position of every town
and the character of the district in which it is
situated, that no hard and fast lines can be laid
down in reply to this question, if, however, the town
is fortunate enough to be the centre of an agricultural
district, or there are ready and economical means of
conveying the refuse there, no difficulty should be
experienced in disposing of it, if not altogether at a
profit, at least at a small loss upon the cost of collection,
as farmers and market gardeners will readily
buy house refuse at prices varying from sixpence to
three shillings a load to use as a top dressing or
manure upon their land, and a very rich and
fertilizing manure it makes, notwithstanding the
outcry that is sometimes raised against it that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
produces rank weeds, owing to the seeds of such
vegetation being found in every domestic dustbin, the
fact really being that all manures will foster and
help the growth of weeds, as well as cereals or roots,
and the appearance of a prolific crop of weeds points
rather to bad and careless farming than to the use
of inferior manure.</p>

<p>In order to suit the convenience of the customers
for refuse, and in order to prevent any delay in its
collection from the houses, it is necessary for every
town to provide one or more depôts in which the
refuse may be so deposited from day to day as it is
collected.</p>

<p>The site of each depôt should be very carefully
selected, bearing the following requisitions in mind:&mdash;</p>

<p>They should not be at greater distances from the
town than would allow the carts to make from three
to four journeys a day, and it is evident that their
position should, so much as possible, avoid the
necessity for the carts to pass <em>through</em> the town when
full; they must also be placed so as to be readily
accessible to the carts and waggons of the farmers,
the customers, and above all, they must be so situated
with regard to any dwelling-houses or public roads
as not to cause any nuisance, or be injurious to
health in any possible manner, and for this purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
a knowledge of the prevailing wind in that neighbourhood
would be useful, and care must also be
taken that no stream or water-course from which the
supply of any drinking water is obtained is likely to
become polluted by having such an unpleasant neighbour
as a "refuse depôt."</p>

<p>The depôt need only be an open field securely
railed off against trespassers or pilferers, but as it
generally swarms with countless numbers of rats, it
is just as well that no stacks or barns should be
erected in its vicinity, if their owner has any wish to
preserve his corn.</p>

<p>In this depôt, the site of which has been selected
with all due care, the refuse should be made up into
measured heaps, a convenient size for them being
found to be twelve feet square by six feet high; these
heaps are then sold as they stand to farmers and
others who send their carts and waggons to remove
them, thus preventing any possibility of mistake or
dispute arising as to the number of loads each
customer pays for and receives. The refuse, when
first brought into the depôt, is far more bulky than
it afterwards becomes, and it shrinks nearly twelve
per cent. after a few months' exposure to wind and
rain; it is therefore necessary to unload each cart as
it arrives from the town on to an enormous heap or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
mound, from the other end of which the measured
heaps are made up after the material has become
stale and sunken. Another cause for the shrinkage
and reduction of bulk of house refuse after reception
at the depôt is the necessary removal of all the old
tins, broken crockery, broken flower pots, &amp;c., before
it can be sold to the farmer, and a very difficult
matter it is to know how to deal with this heterogeneous
mass of absolutely useless articles thus left
behind, unless they can be used for bottoming roads,
or for agricultural or for deep land drainage, or for
filling up hollows of land not afterwards intended to
be built upon, when these materials would be very
useful and acceptable for such purposes, otherwise
they must be kept and allowed to cumber the ground
until some such use can be assigned to them.</p>

<p>All towns are not so conveniently situated with
regard to their surrounding neighbourhood, as will
permit their authorities to sell the collected house
refuse to farmers, market-gardeners, or others, for
use as manure, and in such cases, where they cannot
do so, other measures must be resorted to, in order
to dispose of it in the most economical and sanitary
manner.</p>

<p>Among the numerous questions that I addressed to
the various towns of England when engaged in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
preparing the returns to which reference has already
been made, was one to the following effect:&mdash;"How
is the refuse disposed of after collection?"</p>

<p>Many and various were the replies to this.
Amongst them were the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>In many towns it is stated that the whole of the
refuse is used by brick makers, in others it is simply
"tipped to waste." In one case the answer is,
"Sold by auction twice a year," but to whom it is
sold, and for what purpose, does not transpire. In
some towns it appears to be mixed with lime and
used as manure upon the fields, and in others it is
mixed with the sludge of the sewage farms, and is
then ploughed or dug into the soil of the farm. This
seems a better plan than that of another town, where
it is "given or thrown away," although the difficulty
of disposing of the old iron, tins, &amp;c., is not touched
upon in any of the foregoing answers. The next
reply states that "it is riddled, and the cinders and
vegetable refuse are burnt to generate steam, the fine
dust is used with the manure manufactory (tub
system), the old iron is sold, and the pots, &amp;c., used
for the foundations of roads." In one case the
whole of the refuse is taken out to sea in hopper
barges, and sunk in deep water. In a great number
of towns it is sold by tender for the year, but what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
eventually becomes of it does not transpire. But the
most favoured methods, where it cannot be sold as
manure to farmers, seem to be either that of carting
it away to some spot outside the town, and there
using it for the purpose of filling up hollows and
depressions, or that of giving or selling it to brick-makers.</p>

<p>The practice of filling up hollow places with either
house refuse or street sweepings cannot be too
strongly deprecated, as it stands to reason that some
object is in view when these hollows are thus filled
up, and we may be sure that the object is that of
transforming inconvenient and impracticable pieces
of ground into convenient building sites, whereon,
sooner or later, eligible villas make their sudden
appearance, almost with the rapidity of Aladdin's
Palace, under the magic hand of a jerry builder, and
woe betide the unfortunate being who, struck with
the pretentious appearance and low rent of one of
these eligible family residences, takes up his abode
therein, for so surely will disease, and perhaps death,
be his visitor. I will not here enter into the details,
or describe the medical reasons why such sites are
unhealthy for dwelling-houses, as the fact is almost
self-evident, and the practise of using either house
refuse or street sweepings for such a purpose has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
been condemned by sanitary experts over and over
again. But I will pass on to describe a method of
disposal of town refuse which is now gaining some
popularity in localities where difficulties are experienced
in getting rid of the refuse by any of the
means to which reference has been made, and which
up to the present time seems to be the best solution
of the difficulty. I allude to the process of the
destruction of the refuse by fire. With this object in
view a Mr. Fryer has invented an apparatus which
he styles a "Patent Carboniser, for the conversion of
garbage, street, and market sweepings, also other
vegetable refuse into charcoal." This apparatus
consists of a structure somewhat resembling, externally,
a brick kiln. It is divided into hopper-shaped
compartments, which at the bottom are furnished
with a furnace, fitted with a reverbatory arch. A fire
is lighted in this furnace, the necessary combustion
being obtained, and the heat maintained, by burning
the cinders, which are sifted out of the house refuse
for this purpose.</p>

<p>All the street sweepings, refuse, garbage, &amp;c., is
then thrown in at the top of the kiln, and it is there
and then completely destroyed by the action of the
fire, and converted into charcoal, which is withdrawn
through a sliding door fixed at the bottom of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
kiln. The inventor further contends that his Carboniser
not only burns everything within it so
thoroughly and completely as to produce effectual
deodorisation, but also that in the process all noxious
gases which may be driven off the burning organic
matters contained in the refuse are themselves burnt
and destroyed.</p>

<p>Mr. Fryer has also patented another apparatus
which he calls a "Destructor for reducing the bulk
for purifying and fusing mineral refuse of towns, the
residue to be converted into concrete or mortar."
This apparatus is somewhat similar in construction
and mode of action to the "Carboniser," except that
it has no tall kiln containing the hopper-shaped compartments.
Great heat is, however, necessary in
order to fuse the mass of heterogeneous articles that
are thrown into it, and its success is greatly dependant
upon such heat being constantly and efficiently maintained.
It is said that the cost of an establishment
to dispose of the refuse by this means, consisting of
one six celled Destructor and an eight-celled Carboniser,
boiler, steam engine, mortar pans, cooler,
chimney, shaft, and buildings, is about £4,500.</p>

<p>Each cell is stated to deal with about 50 cwt. of
refuse in every twenty-four hours, and that no
nuisance is experienced in the vicinity of the depôts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
This apparatus has, I understand, been adopted in
Kralingen, Leeds, Blackburn, Bradford, Warrington,
and Derby, and is about to be adopted in other
important places.</p>

<p>It is not my intention here to describe or to discuss
the question of the collection and disposal of night
soil, which in many towns is intimately connected
and amalgamated with the collection of house refuse
and the cleansing of streets. It is a subject of
sufficient importance to be dealt with separately.
The following particulars, however, with reference to
the collection of house refuse in connection with the
pail system at Manchester will not be out of place,
especially with regard to the reference which is made
to Fryer's Carbonisers and Destructors, and it must
be borne in mind that the refuse here spoken of is
<em>wet</em>, which makes the difficulties connected with its
destruction by fire greater than it would be if only
dry, or comparatively dry, house refuse had to be
destroyed. These particulars are gleaned from a
report contained in a copy of the <cite>British Architect</cite>,
of 1876, of a visit by the members of the Manchester
Scientific and Mechanical Society to the works of the
Manchester Corporation Health Committee, the
figures being altered so as to conform more closely
with the growth of the work since that year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>There are about 56,000 closets in Manchester,
44,000 of which have been constructed on the cinder
sifter principle, and are emptied during the day, the
remainder are emptied during the night.</p>

<p>The contents of the new closets are brought away
by vans specially constructed for the purpose, having
five compartments, one of which is open and uncovered,
and this receives the dry refuse; the other
four compartments are covered and enclosed with
tightly fitting doors. Each of these compartments
holds six galvanised iron pails, which are also
covered with closely fitting lids. The van bottoms
are panelled, and the inside of each panel is filled
with a layer of carbolic acid powder, one inch thick,
and they are thoroughly cleansed after each journey.</p>

<p>The Health Committee employ 100 of these
vehicles, each one making four journeys per day.
The contents of the closets which are emptied during
the night are taken away in open carts, two-thirds to
the tips and the remainder along with the refuse
brought into the yard by the vans, is sent each night
into the country.</p>

<p>The amount of material dealt with each week by
the Health Committee is about 3,000 tons, and may
be described as follows:&mdash;Paper, 1 ton; rags, 3 tons;
dead animals, dogs, cats, rats, mice, guinea pigs, &amp;c.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
2 tons; stable manure, 17 tons; meat tins, old tin
and iron, 33 tons; refuse from slaughter-houses and
fish shops, &amp;c., 60 tons; broken pots, bottles, and
glasses, 80 tons; vegetable refuse, door mats, table
covers, floorcloths, old straw mattresses, 100 tons;
fine ashes, 1,230 tons; cinders, 1,400 tons.</p>

<p>The Committee employ in this department over 500
men, including clerks, inspectors, wheelwrights,
smiths, saddlers, tinmen, engineers, mechanics,
manure and mortar makers, stablemen, and
labourers. They have 156 horses, and about the
same number of vehicles of various descriptions.</p>

<p>When the loaded vans reach the yard, they are
first weighed, afterwards they are taken on to the
first floor of a two-storey building, where the dry
refuse from the open part of each van is unloaded
and shovelled on to sieves worked by steam power.
By this arrangement the fine dust widely diffusing
itself in its descent, falls on to the floor below,
covering the contents of the pails, which are, at the
same time, being emptied on to grids fixed in the
floor. At one end of these grids the bars are set
much more closely together than at the other, and
serve to convey the liquid portion of the contents of
the pails by means of troughs to a tank where it is
further dealt with. The solid portion of the excreta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
falls through the wide-barred portion of the grid into
suitable receptacles. The rough portion of the dry
refuse, after being separated from the fine, is carried
along a movable and endless table to the mortar
mills, the boiler, or to one of the various furnaces, of
which there are several in the yard. This dry refuse
is of such a heterogeneous character as to require
various modes of treatment. It is made up of paper,
rats, meat tins, straw, cabbage leaves, onions, apples,
turnips, fish bones, dead cats, rabbits, guinea pigs,
fowls, brush heads, old boots, old books, knives, forks,
spoons, children's toys, old hats, old bonnets,
crinoline wires, umbrella frames, broken pots, broken
bottles, preserve jars, medicine bottles, old mattresses,
cinders, bits of coal, firewood, bass, broken bricks,
and a host of other articles too numerous to mention.
When this mass of rubbish is somewhat assorted, the
cinders are separated and used for fuel for the boilers
and furnaces (no coal whatever is allowed in the
yard), the remaining portion of the rubbish along
with some most vile and abominable matter which
occasionally comes to the yard in the pails, is taken
to the Carbonisers (of which there is a nest of eight
in the yard), and the obnoxious material is therein
carbonised and is resolved into a perfectly harmless
material.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>In another part of the yard is a second set of
furnaces which are called destructors, and are used
for the purpose of destroying rubbish, which before-time,
for many years past, has been deposited in
large heaps in every suburb of the city, to the great
annoyance of the inhabitants whose fate it was to
live in the vicinities of these deposits. These
destructors not only consume this objectionable
material, but they furnish heat to a concretor which
is placed in close contiguity. The spent fuel is
carted to the mills, and is there converted into
mortar&mdash;a mortar, too, of the best description&mdash;as
the samples of brickwork built with it and exhibited
abundantly testify. This concretor, which is driven
by steam power, is a large cylinder of a peculiar
internal construction, which exposes an extensive
evaporating surface to the heat from the destructor,
which passes through the cylinder from end to end.
The work of this concretor is to subject the urine or
liquid portion of the contents of the pails fed by
means of the troughs already spoken of in connection
with the tank. The urine is pumped from this tank
into the concretor at the rate of about 150 gallons
per hour. The concentrated urine, which contains a
large quantity of ammonia, is mixed with two-thirds
its weight of charcoal, and the composition forms a
most valuable manure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>The carboniser, the destructor, and the concretor
have all been invented and patented by Mr. Alfred
Fryer, of the firm of Manlove, Alliot &amp; Co., engineers,
Nottingham. The process of carbonising is patented
by the Universal Charcoal Company, Limited, who
are to receive a royalty, we understand, from the
Health Committee for the use of their patent. There
is a tall and noble-looking chimney in the centre of
the yard surrounded by many new buildings and
sheds, and this has been built with the concrete
mortar manufactured by the Health Committee.</p>

<p>Such is the gigantic scale upon which these matters
are dealt with in the City of Manchester.</p>

<p>The other methods, to which reference has been
made, for the disposal of town refuse require no
further comment, as it is evident that unless a ready
sale for the refuse can be effected, by far the best
method of disposing of it seems to be that by which it
is completely annihilated by fire in the manner that
has been described, or in some other similar manner.</p>

<p>Having thus far followed the house refuse from its
first appearance in its cradle, the dustbin, through
its chequered career after collection down to its
decease, either by burial, or by cremation, the
question of the cost of the whole of this work must
be deferred until the final chapter, after I have dealt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
with the subject of street sweeping and cleansing, the
removal of snow, and a short chapter upon street
watering, which is somewhat analagous to scavenging,
and is frequently included in the accounts of that
work in the estimates which are prepared by a Local
Authority.</p>

"STREET CLEANSING."</h2>


<p>Clean well-swept streets not only add materially to
the prosperous appearance of a town, but they also
have a very marked influence upon its health and
upon the morale of its inhabitants; wet, and muddy,
badly formed, ill-drained streets, cause dampness in
the subsoil of the dwelling-houses in the vicinity,
and a humidity in the atmosphere, both of which
tend to produce a low standard of health in their
neighbourhood, irrespective of the wet surface
through which pedestrians have to wade whenever
they are obliged to cross such streets. Dusty streets,
too, are very injurious from the fact of persons
inhaling the gritty silicate loaded air arising from
them; such an atmosphere is known to produce
disease of the lungs, even when it is free from the
dust arising from horse droppings or other organic
impurities. Professor Tyndall, in his beautiful
experiments, has proved that dusty air is alive with
the germs of the bacteria of putrefaction, whilst the
pure fresh air which he gathered on a mountain peak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
in the Alps is innocent of such germs, and is
absolutely powerless to produce any organisms.
Persons living in streets that are improperly swept
or watered are unable to open the doors or windows
of their houses with impunity by reason of the dust.</p>

<p>The definition of the word <em>street</em>, as given in the
Public Health Act, 1875, is as follows:&mdash;"Street
includes any highway (not being a turnpike road),
and any public bridge (not being a county bridge),
and any road, lane, footway, square, court, alley, or
passage, whether a thoroughfare or not."</p>

<p>With reference to turnpike roads the Act further
states that any Urban Authority may by agreement
with the Trustees of any turnpike road, or with the
Surveyor of any county bridge, take on themselves
the maintenance, repair, cleansing, or watering of
such street or road.</p>

<p>It is very questionable, however, whether the onus
of cleansing private courts and alleys which are not
repairable by the Urban Authority should be borne
by them, although for the sake of the public health
it is highly desirable that such work should be so
undertaken.</p>

<p>The great difficulty attached to this duty arises
from the fact that as a rule these private courts and
alleys are very badly paved, if paved at all, full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
pits, where pools of stagnant mud and water collect,
and even in the best cases, the interstices between
the pebbles, or other paving, are filled with filth
arising in great measure from the dirty habits of the
people, and this filth it is found exceedingly difficult
to dislodge. The remedy for this is to compel the
owners of the abutting properties to have the courts
and alleys properly paved with asphalte, or other
equally impervious material, after which it would be
easy for the Urban Authority to cause them to be
swept at least once a day, and flushed with water in
the hot weather once a week, but in order to compel
the owners to execute this very desirable work it
would be necessary to put the complicated machinery
of section 150 of the Public Health Act, 1875, in
force, and the expense to the landlords would be in
many cases very disproportionate to the value of
their property.</p>

<p>Out of the ninety towns to which reference has
before been made, the authorities of only nineteen of
them cleanse the private courts and alleys in their
jurisdiction. The sweeping and cleansing of streets
should be effected either at night or very early in the
morning; if, however, the bad practice of bringing
the house refuse out into the streets in inappropriate
receptacles is in vogue, it becomes necessary to sweep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the street later in the day, after the contents of these
receptacles has been removed. In most cases it is
necessary to cleanse the principal streets of a town
at least once a day, and this appears to be the
practice of nearly all the ninety towns referred to,
but only seven of them appear to have this operation
repeated more frequently; in several cases, however,
the horse droppings, &amp;c., are removed at once, under
what is called the "orderly" system, and this is
especially necessary in streets that are paved with
such materials as wood paving, asphalte, or granite
setts. The suburban streets of a town need only be
cleansed once or twice a week, except in special cases
of extremes of mud or snow. It is important, however,
that the gully pits in all parts of the town
should be cleared out constantly, and men should be
employed for this purpose, as well as to cleanse and
disinfect all the cabstands and public urinals at least
once every day.</p>

<p>Street cleansing is effected either by hand-sweeping
and hand-scraping, or by machinery. As to which
is the most economical much depends upon the value
of labour, and also upon the condition of the roads
to be dealt with, but in point of time and as a general
rule the value of a horse rotary brush-sweeping
machine is undoubted, the only time at which such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
machine fails to do effective work is on the occasions
when the mud to be removed (owing to a peculiar
condition of the atmosphere), has attained a semi-solidity,
and is of a stiff and sticky consistency, when
it either adheres to and clogs the brushes of the
machine, or is flattened by them on to the road
instead of being removed.</p>

<p>The simplest and best of these machines, in my
opinion, is that manufactured by Messrs. Smith &amp;
Sons, of Barnard Castle. It sweeps a clear width of
six feet, the rotary brush, which is divided into four
or more parts, works diagonally, it is drawn easily by
one horse, clearing itself of mud or dust in its
progress, and the makers say that it can sweep
15,000 square yards of road surface in one hour, this
being equivalent to the ordinary work of about 50
men in the same time!</p>

<p>The price of this machine is £30, and being of
very simple construction it costs little or nothing in
repairs, except for the brushes, which last for about
180 hours when in constant work. These can, however,
be replaced at a cost of £2 15s. per set, or the
old stocks can be refilled with bass, at a more
moderate figure. It is, of course, necessary to sweep
the ridge of dust or mud which is left by the machine
at the side of the street into heaps by hand labour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and to remove it by carts; other machines have been
invented for cleansing streets, which by means of
elevators, or other gear, profess to raise the mud or
dust direct into the carts, which are to be attached at
the back of the machine, but hitherto these machines
have been found to be too cumbersome, costly, and
complicated for the purpose, and they have not
consequently found much favour with Sanitary
Authorities.</p>

<p>Messrs. Smith &amp; Sons also construct a patent road
scraping machine, which is drawn by one horse, and
which will, they say, scrape upwards of 10,000 square
yards of road surface in an hour.</p>

<p>The strength and durability of the hand brooms
purchased by an Urban Authority for the work of
sweeping the streets is of some importance, as
affecting the ultimate cost of the work, and some
care and skill is required in their selection.</p>

<p>Bass brooms are better than birch brooms for this
purpose, and the bass of which the brooms are made
should be sufficiently stout and of regular thickness;
it should be tough and elastic, not old, dry, and
brittle, each knot should be of uniform size and be
firmly set, and the number of knots in each broom
head is also a matter of choice. A convenient and
fair test of the soundness of a broom is to soak it for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
a few days in water before issuing it to the sweeper,
and then note the time it will last. The handles of
the brooms should be made of alder wood.</p>

<p>The mode of construction of streets, and the
materials of which they are formed, makes a considerable
difference in the amount of cleansing
necessary, and upon the quantity of mud or dust
that has to be removed from their surface. In
making any investigations for the purpose of deciding
what difference exists in the question of cleansing
various forms and descriptions of pavements, climatic
influence introduces a rather disturbing element,
which may seriously affect any conclusions that may
be drawn; it may, however, be taken for granted that
a street, the surface of which is metalled on the
macadam principle with stones of a soft or gritty
character, will require more cleansing and be more
costly to scavenge (under the same conditions of
climate and traffic), than a street paved with the
hardest granite setts or with blocks of wood, or with
asphalte, and at the same time much care will have
to be taken not to <em>over</em> sweep or <em>over</em> scrape a road
with a macadamised surface, or much injury will be
done to it.</p>

<p>Amongst the influences that disturb the results of
any investigations made with respect to street<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
cleansing, that of the amount and character of the
traffic over it must not be lost sight of, and the state
of repair and gradient of the street are both of
considerable importance in affecting the results, the
practice too, of bringing out the house refuse into
the streets in improper receptacles pending the
arrival of the scavengers' cart, must also cause a
varying amount of refuse to be swept from its
surface, depending upon the habits of the persons
living in the street.</p>

<p>The Superintendent of the Scavenging Department
at Liverpool has made some observations and
obtained some valuable information on these points,
which he has detailed in a report he presented to
the Health Committee of that borough in the year
1877, an abstract of which is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>He adds that the full benefit of the impervious
pavements as regards the cost of scavenging has not
yet been felt, for almost all the lines of streets so
paved are intersected at short distances by streets of
ordinary jointed granite setts or macadam, whence a
quantity of mud and refuse is dragged by the traffic
on to the asphalted jointed roadways, which are consequently
debited with the cost of removal of some
effete material not intrinsically belonging to them.
He further adds that the credit reductions to be made
in respect of the value of manure obtained from each
description of carriageway is not readily ascertainable.
In dry weather the value of manure collected from
granite setts, with or without impervious joints, is
about equal, but when the sweepings are wet, and
consequently of little value for sale, the quantity
yielded by the ordinary pervious jointed pavement is
greater than from the impervious, and therefore the
total value is relatively favourable to the latter class,
whilst to get rid of the sweepings from macadamised
streets is a source of additional expense. He concludes
this portion of his valuable report by observing
that the advantages of the new impervious pavements
over the old kinds are especially shown after frost
and snowfall, the results of which cause the setts of
ordinarily jointed roadways to become loose, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
allow a vast amount of mud to ooze up between the
softened joints. The comparison is still more
apparent in regard to macadam, which, unless a
heavy rainfall succeeds the thaw, cannot be swept for
some days without great destruction being caused to
the metalling of the roadway.</p>

<p>The ultimate disposal of the material removed
from the surface of a macadamised roadway, being
principally composed <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'of sillicate'">of silicate</ins>, and consequently
valueless as a manure, is a difficult matter.</p>

<p>In small towns, except during abnormally muddy
weather, it may be mixed with the house refuse and
sold to farmers, or the road scrapings themselves
may be used as an excellent sand, if thoroughly
washed, to mix with lime or cement to form mortar
for public works; excessive accumulations of mud,
however, must be got rid of in the most economical
and speedy manner, and this is effected either by
filling up old disused quarries with it, or depositing
it upon waste lands, or forming embankments for
new roads, but in no case should it be used, as I
have before stated, upon building sites; it is difficult
and expensive to destroy it or partially convert it into
other matters by fire, so that if these methods which
I have enumerated are impracticable, the only other
method left for the disposal of the sweepings or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
scrapings from the streets is to take them out to sea
in hopper barges and sink them in deep water.</p>

<p>In the City of Paris an area of about 13,000,000
square yards of streets are cleansed between three
and six a.m. in the summer months and four and
seven in the winter. This work in connection with
the collection of the house refuse employs 2,200 men,
950 women, and 30 boys, besides 190 mechanical
sweepers.</p>

<p>The Paris mud is said to no longer possess the
manurial strength of former times, and in consequence
the receipts derived by the municipality from
this source have greatly diminished. At the present
time it is disposed of by public tender to responsible
contractors, who manage to take between them some
2,500 cubic yards daily.</p>

<p>The following additional particulars of the manner
in which this work is carried out in Paris will, I
think, prove of interest, especially with regard to the
use of disinfectants, which are largely used in that
city in connection with the cleansing of the streets, a
practice which might be followed with advantage by
the Sanitary Authorities of this country.</p>

<p>The cleansing of the public thoroughfares in Paris,
which was formerly undertaken by the Prefect of
Police, is now a function of the Prefect of the Seine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
The staff consists of two chief engineers, one for
each group of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arrondissements</span>, one group being sub-divided
into three sections, each under the charge of
an executive engineer, and the other into five sections
similarly supervised. These sectional engineers have
under them 51 superintendents and 61 overseers,
whose employment costs annually £10,400. The
scavenging plant is kept in a central depôt, where
materials of every description are stored and classified
for ordinary and extraordinary service, when snow
and ice render additional assistants necessary.</p>

<p>The depôts contain supplies of chloride of lime,
sulphate of zinc, sulphate of iron, and carbolic acid,
as disinfectants; and hydrochloric acid and nitrobenzide,
as cleansing agents. The chloride of lime,
of a strength of 100° to 105°, is successfully employed
for the disinfecting of places tainted with urine or
faecal matter, also for cleansing gutters carrying any
sewage water. Sulphate of iron and sulphate of
zinc are both used under the same conditions.
Sulphate of iron has the disadvantage of rusting
objects to which it is applied, sulphate of zinc is
stronger in its action, but it costs a little more; it
produces no smell, nor does it leave any stain; it is
much employed in summer for washing and watering
the basements of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">"Halles Centrales,"</span> which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
used for fish, poultry, and offal. At a strength of
one-eighth, and mixed with three per cent. of sulphate
of copper, sulphate of zinc makes a good disinfecting
liquor, which preserves its qualities a long time, and
is of great use in private houses. Carbolic acid is
not, strictly speaking, a disinfectant; it does not act
like chloride on putrid matter, but it arrests and
prevents fermentation, doubtless by destroying the
spores, it is, therefore, always employed when it is
desired to destroy the germs of putrid fermentation.
It is used at a strength of about one-fortieth, say a
gallon of acid to 40 gallons of water. At strengths of
one-one hundredth and one-two hundredth it gives good
results for watering once or twice a week in summer
those parts of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">"Halles Centrales"</span> liable to
infection; it is even used as low as one-one thousandth
for watering streets and gutters. Hydrochloric acid
is applied to urinals and slaughter-houses, in places
much encrusted with tartar; it is used at a strength of
one-sixth, lowered to one-tenth, it cleans smooth walls
and flags efficiently, in ordinary rinsings a strength
of one-fifteenth suffices; it leaves a disagreeable odour
behind, which is, however, quickly dissipated. Nitrobenzide
is more energetic than the foregoing, but it
produces a disagreeable smell of bitter almonds and
leaves a white film, which has to be washed off; it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
used at the same strengths as hydrochloric acid.
The annual cost for plant and disinfecting materials
of all descriptions is £8,800.</p>

"SNOW."</h2>


<p>The unthinking ratepayer frequently exclaims,
"Why cannot the authorities order this abominable
snow to be immediately carted away?" when the
footpath and roadway in front of his domicile lie
hidden under a thick coating of snow crystals.</p>

<p>Signor E. Bignami Sormani, assisted by Professor
Clericetti, have made several most interesting investigations
and observations upon the density of fresh
fallen snow in Milan by means of a simple balance
and compressing box. The range of weight of the
snow was found to vary as much as eleven times the
minimum. A cubic yard from one snowstorm,
weighing as much as 814 pounds, while an equal
bulk from another fall only weighed 71 pounds. The
weight consequently of a cubic foot of the densest
snow is 30.14 pounds, whilst a cubic foot of water
weighs 62.5 pounds, or only about double the weight
of this dense snow, but which was in all probability
little different from ice.</p>

<p>For my purposes, however, I will take a mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
between these extreme weights, and assume that the
weight of a cubic foot of snow is 16.38 pounds, and
that a fall of three inches of snow during the night
has caused the ejaculation with which I commenced
this chapter to proceed from the aforesaid ratepayer.</p>

<p>The ordinary width of an English street may be
taken at thirty-six feet, including the footpaths, so
that on every one hundred yards in length of every
street of that width 2,700 cubic feet of snow have
fallen, the total weight of which amounts to 44,226
pounds, or very nearly 20 tons, which in actual bulk
would represent 100 cubic yards. But as the snow
would soon become compressed after falling, I assume
that this bulk would be diminished by one-half, and
that consequently (without reckoning the snow which
has fallen upon roofs and into courts, passages, and
alleys, and which has been quickly shovelled therefrom
to the street by the occupiers) about 40 ordinary
cartloads, weighing half a ton each, would have to be
removed from this length of street. Assuming that
there are 30 miles of street in a town from which the
snow must be <em>immediately</em> removed, 21,144 loads
must be carted somewhere, at a cost of at least
£1,500, assuming that each cart could make ten
trips a day, and even then it would take 352 carts a
whole week to effect it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>It may be contended that I have taken an extreme
case, and that, of course, the snow does not lie for
very long upon the ground in the condition in which
it fell, and that hourly it is reducing in bulk and
weight by being ground up by the traffic, and finding
its way in the form of water into the sewers, but I
have simply advanced the few facts which I have
stated in order to give some idea of the labour and
cost of snow clearing in a city or town, and I think I
cannot do better than at once describe how this
important work is carried out in the city of Milan,
where the organization and arrangements by which
it is accomplished with marvellous despatch, and
efficiency, could with advantage be copied by the
authorities of any of our towns which are occasionally
visited by excessive falls of snow.</p>

<p>In Milan the snow carts are emptied into the
navigable canals and numerous watercourses by
which the city is intersected; and latterly also into
the new sewers in the central portion of the city,
which are promptly flushed whenever it snows.
During the winter of 1879-80 the cost of clearing the
1,656,200 square yards total area of squares, streets,
and lanes within the city walls, averaged £200 per
inch depth of snow fallen, and for the 502,800 square
yards outside the walls the average cost was £62<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
per inch depth, equivalent in each case to about
1.05d. per cubic yard. Ordinarily the clearing of the
more frequented streets is completed within eight or
ten hours after it has stopped snowing; and of the
rest within 24 hours, not reckoning night. The city
is parcelled out into small districts, numbering 112
for last winter, of varying extent according to the
importance of the work in each. An average rate of
pay per inch depth of snow fallen is settled for the
whole area of each separate district, according to its
extent and the particular conditions affecting the
several streets and squares comprised within it.
Each district is allotted to a contractor, who usually
associates with himself six to ten partners, besides
the labourers whom he employs. He has to find
carts, horses, and carters; the necessary implements&mdash;spades,
shovels, brooms, scrapers, mattocks,
barrows, &amp;c.&mdash;are furnished by the city, under suitable
stipulations for ensuring proper care in their
use. The contracts are made annually, and the
same persons almost always apply for them again
year after year. The contractors come principally
from the trades that are interrupted by winter, viz.:&mdash;Paviors,
bricklayers and masons, and gravel quarrymen.
For the direction and supervision of the work
the whole city is divided into four sections, over each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
of which is appointed an engineer, with an assistant,
who are aided in the general arrangements by the
police surveillance. Payment is made only for work
effectually done. In each snowstorm the depth of
snow falling, which is the basis of pay, is ascertained
by means of a number of stone posts, fixed in suitable
open spaces, clear of shelter from buildings, and each
capped with a flat horizontal slab of stone. As soon
as it stops snowing, or two or three times during a
storm of several hours, the depth of snow caught on
the slabs is measured by the engineer in the presence
of two of the contractors in his section. The number
of men ordinarily engaged in snow clearing on a
winter's day is not less than two thousand, and has
sometimes risen to three thousand. The stock of
implements found by the city, representing a capital
of about £1,600, is housed in two stores in opposite
quarters of the city. In the winter of 1874-75 the
total fall of snow amounted to 40¾ inches, and the
whole expenditure for clearing it within the city walls
exceeded £8,400; while in 1877-78 the fall was only
5¼ inches, involving an expenditure of less than
£1,040 for a slightly larger area.</p>

<p>The small cost at which this work is carried out in
Milan is accounted for by the low rate of wages and
cart hire, and the perfect organization of the system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>When a fall of snow occurs in Paris, attention is
first directed to <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'clearing the foothpaths'">clearing the footpaths</ins> and crossings,
so as to ensure uninterrupted foot passenger traffic.
The town scavengers sand the roads whenever it is
necessary for the carriage traffic, at the same time
numerous auxiliaries are organised to remove the
snow from the principal thoroughfares in the order of
their relative importance. To assist in removing the
snow the General Omnibus Company are bound by
their concession to furnish 50 waggons, and carts are
specially arranged for with the providers of sand and
gravel at the beginning of winter, the contractors for
maintaining the public roads being also bound to
hold their carts at the disposition of the sectional
engineers. In certain cases the half-melted snow is
swept into the sewers, especially into those carrying
warm water. Melting by steam has been tried, when
a continuous jet was turned on to a mass of banked
snow, but it melted very slowly at first, and the
melting ceased after the cavity had increased to a
certain size. Two descriptions of snow ploughs are
kept in store, one for manual, the other for horse
power, but they have never been used, as the coating
of snow seldom attains sufficient thickness, and it is
too quickly compressed and hardened by the traffic.
As a rule, the sum allowed in the budget, about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
£7,000, suffices for the extra labour incurred, but
occasionally severe winters cause this to be greatly
exceeded, as in 1875-76, when the increase amounted
to £8,000, and no doubt in the winter that has just
passed, 1880-81, the estimate must also have been
largely exceeded.</p>

<p>In England one of the greatest difficulties we have
to contend against is the disposal of the snow after
it has been placed in the cart.</p>

<p>If there is a river close by, it can be taken there
and tipped, but this is objectionable if it is a
navigable river where dredging has to be done, as it
is surprising what a quantity of road scrapings and
other matters are always removed with the snow, and
these materials naturally sink to the bottom, and add
considerably to the cost of dredging.</p>

<p>If there are public parks the snow may be heaped
in them, provided no damage is done to the grass or
paths, as the snow thus heaped takes a considerable
time to melt, the first effect of a thaw being to consolidate
it, but a better plan is to deposit it upon any
waste spots, if these are not too far from the streets
which have to be cleared.</p>

<p>Tipping the snow down the manholes into the
sewers has been tried in London and other cities, but
has failed through the snow consolidating, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
although lighted gas jets have been turned on to the
snow, it has still melted too slowly to be of any
practical utility.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that a steam jet should be
turned on the snow as it lies in the streets, or after it
has been heaped, but I very much doubt the efficacy
of this plan, although Messrs. Merryweather &amp; Co.,
of London, have, I understand, melted a cartload of
snow in seven minutes. It might, however, be
possible to melt the snow by the heat generated in
the furnaces that are destroying the house refuse by
fire, and this could be effected without any large
expense beyond the cost of cartage of the snow to the
depôts, which would, of course, be necessary.</p>

<p>Failing an organization such as that of Milan, the
following suggestions may be of use to those who
have sometimes to grapple with this unproductive
work:&mdash;</p>

<p>Do not attempt to cart away the snow while it is
yet falling, but try to make clear crossings for the
foot passengers and to keep the traffic open. If there
should be a high wind at the time, and the snow
drifts in consequence, cut through the drifts so as to
allow the vehicular traffic to continue.</p>

<p>Directly the snow ceases to fall put on all available
hands to clear the channel gutters and street gratings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
in preparation for a sudden thaw, when, if these
precautions were not taken, serious flooding and
great damage to property might ensue; for the same
reason cart away all the snow you can at the bottom
of gradients and in the valleys, and also from very
narrow streets and passages, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the wider streets use the snow plough, or with
gangs of men (in the snow season there is generally
plenty of labour obtainable), shovel the snow into a long
narrow heap on each side of the street, taking care to
leave the channel gutters and gratings quite clear, and
a sufficient space between the heaps for at least two
lines of traffic. Passages must also be cut at frequent
intervals through the heaps, in order to allow foot
passengers to cross the street, and also to let the
water reach the channel gutters as soon as the snow
begins to melt.</p>

<p>With regard to the question of clearing the snow
from the footpaths irrespective of the larger duty of
clearing it from the streets, it is often a disputed
point in a town as to whether this should be done by
the Urban Authority at the expense of the rates, or
by the householders themselves, and this can only be
settled where the town has a private improvement
act, in which a clause or clauses may be inserted
throwing the onus of such cleansing and sweeping of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the footpaths upon the several and respective occupiers
of houses and buildings. But on whoever the duty
rests there is no doubt that the easiest and quickest
method of effecting a thorough cleansing of a footpath
from snow is by an application of salt, and then
to sweep off the slush that is engendered with a
broom. Medical men and others, however, assert
that the practice of putting salt with the snow is to
make a freezing mixture, which is detrimental to the
health of persons walking on such a mixture, and
there can be no doubt that excessive cold is caused
by this practice, often sufficiently severe to crack the
flagstones of the foot pavement.</p>

<p>In the City of London the footways are swept once
daily by men in the employment of the Commissioners
of Sewers, and in wet weather those in the
main streets are cleansed repeatedly during the day,
and this has been done, I believe, since the year
1872, although the occupiers are legally liable for the
execution of this work.</p>

<p>In Liverpool, also, this is done after a fall of
snow, as will appear from the following interesting
remarks on the subject, contained in a report by the
Superintendent of the Scavenging Department in
that borough:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The only way to compass the removal of snow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
from the footwalks of the principal thoroughfares
within a comparatively short time is by sprinkling
them with salt such as is commonly used for agricultural
purposes. It is certain that, unaided by
the salt, a sufficient number of men cannot be
procured for the emergency of clearing snow from
the footways of the most important thoroughfares.
It has been stated by medical authorities that the
application of salt to snow is detrimental to the
health of people who have to walk through the
'slush' produced by the mixture, and that the
excessive cooling of the air surrounding the places
where the application has been made is injurious to
delicate persons. It, therefore, seems that the
application of salt to snow should not be undertaken
during the day time, but should be commenced
not before 11 p.m., nor continued after
6 a.m., and that only such an area of footwalks
should be so treated on any one night as the
available staff of men can clear by an early hour
the following morning.</p>

<p>"To sweep snow from the footwalks whilst the fall
of snow continues, and especially during business
hours, appears to be wasteful and futile, and to
apply salt during the same periods may be held to
be injurious to health.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"That the snow of an ordinary fall can be removed
from the footwalks by an application of salt an
hour or so before they are scraped is an ascertained
fact, except at least when a moderately severe frost
has preceded, accompanied, or followed the snow
fall, or when the snow has drifted into extensive
accumulations. Were it not for the danger to
health by excessive cooling of the air, and for the
expense attending the operation, all the impervious
pavements could be cleared of snow (unless the fall
was a heavy one) in a comparatively short time by
a liberal application of salt and the employment of
the horse sweeping machines as soon as the snow
had become sufficiently softened to admit of their
use."</p>

<p>To these remarks I have nothing to add, except to
suggest that in addition to clearing the snow from
the footpaths care should also be taken to scrape out
and thoroughly clear the roof water trunks, which
are frequently found crossing the footpavements; if
these remain choked damage may ensue to the
adjoining property when a thaw commences.</p>

"STREET WATERING."</h2>


<p>The effective watering of streets and roads in any
town during the summer months is an important
matter, not only on sanitary grounds, but also from
the fact that considerable damage may be caused in
the neighbouring shops, warehouses, and dwellings,
if something is not done to prevent the clouds of
detritus and decaying refuse, of which the dust is
composed, from being blown about. In the metropolis
of London alone, the watering of the streets and
roads employs, in addition to a staff of surveyors,
inspectors, and foremen, about 1,500 men, and an
equal number of horses and carts; and in order to
lay the dust effectually, about 30,000 tons of water
must be spread upon the streets every dry day, the
cost of this gigantic work being nearly £200,000 per
annum upon an average of 120 days, when watering
becomes necessary.</p>

<p>The most commonly known method in this country
for watering the streets and roads of our towns is
that of carrying the water in wheeled barrels, carts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
or vans, and distributing it therefrom through a
perforated pipe upon the surface of the road as the
vehicle is drawn along by a horse attached to the
shafts.</p>

<p>The points of importance to be considered under
this system are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1.) The number and position of the stand posts or
hydrants, from which the water carts are to be filled,
and whether they shall be "swan neck" stand posts
or "valve" hydrants.</p>

<p>(2.) The size and form of the body of the water carts,
as regards its cubical capacity, its weight, strength,
lightness of draught, durability, width of spread, and
shape of jet, so as to ensure evenness of supply without
leaving pools of water or dry patches after it has
passed, or causing that unpleasant cloud of dust
which so often follows the cart.</p>

<p>A wonderful improvement in all these respects has
been lately effected by the introduction of Mr. E. H.
Bayley's Patent Hydrostatic Van, of which I shall
speak more in detail hereafter.</p>

<p>(3.) Another point of some importance is the material
of which the hose shall be constructed, if valve
hydrants and not swan necks are existing. My opinion
is that it should be of leather, as being roughly
handled and little cared for; canvass hose, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
the cheapest, is not sufficiently durable, and is consequently
the dearest in the end; and (4), lastly, the
driver and horse should both be of some intelligence.
A check should also, if possible, be kept upon the
former to see that he performs his allotted task, and
does his proper number of rounds. Mr. Bayley has
also introduced for this purpose a "Tell Tale
Indicator," which records automatically the quantity
of water used; it cannot be tampered with, and
registers on a dial outside the van each load of water
delivered, so that the surveyor or other officer can see
at a glance whether the driver is attending to his
work, or whether the hot weather has made him find
his throat drier than the roads, and he has been
spending some of his time in moistening it. In the
year 1856, Mr. Scott, C.E., the chief surveyor of the
parish of St. Pancras, kept an account of the daily
round of an ordinary water cart, when he found that
through an average working day of 10¼ hours, exclusive
of the breakfast and dinner hours, the cart took
one hour and twenty minutes filling, fifty minutes
only in distributing the water on the roads, and eight
hours and seven minutes in travelling to spread the
water and back to the stand posts. It was obvious
that these were placed too far apart, and by the subsequent
introduction of additional standposts Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Scott found, in the year 1867, that the filling occupied
two hours, the distribution one hour and thirty
minutes, and the travelling to and fro six hours and
thirty minutes, so that it may be assumed, with an
ordinary two-wheeled water cart, that two-thirds of
the day is spent in travelling, one-fifth in filling, and
about one-seventh in the actual spreading.</p>

<p>To many of my readers Bayley's Van is probably
as familiar as it is to me, but it may notwithstanding
be well to describe it. It is a handsome vehicle in
appearance, the body being made of wrought iron
plates, and measures 8 ft. in length by 4 ft. 8 in.
in breadth, and 2 ft. in depth, holding 450 gallons.
It is mounted on springs upon four wheels hung upon
Bayley's patent axles, and has a pair of light shafts;
it can easily be fitted with a break for hilly roads, and
there being no weight at any time upon the horse's
back, he is relieved from any severe strains.</p>

<p>By means of an adjustable valve the flow of water
can be regulated according to the state of the roads,
and, if necessary, a double valve can be inserted, so
that either side of the distributor can be at work
when only half the width is required, or when passing
a carriage or narrow spaces.</p>

<p>The branch pipe is of uniform size, except close to
the spreader, where it enlarges in order to avoid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
friction, and this is assisted by the branch pipe being
shaped into a cycloidal curve on each side.</p>

<p>In order to obtain as great a pressure as possible
upon the jets of the distributing pipe, and thus to
give the side jets a greater trajectory than they otherwise
would have, the tank is elevated as high as is
consistent with the conditions of draught. At the
same time, the distributing pipes are placed as near
to the ground as convenient, so that the maximum
extent of distribution is obtained, and that with less
dust and splashing than in the ordinary system.
The holes in the distributing pipe instead of being
drilled in straight lines, are on a curved line, which
rises along the length of the pipe from the centre
towards the ends. This has been found necessary, in
order that the distributing pipe may be placed low,
and at the same time advantage be taken of the width
of the trajectory of the jets.</p>

<p>Comparing the work of one of these vans with that
reported upon by Mr. Scott, it is found that the van
occupies nine minutes in filling, six minutes in
spreading the water, and only three hours and fifteen
minutes in travelling to and fro, so that in seven
hours it accomplishes as much work as the ordinary
water cart effects in ten hours.</p>

<p>In Edinburgh, where a trial of one of these vans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
took place against one of the old carts, it was found
that the van spread the water a width of 20 feet,
while the old cart only covered 14 feet; the van
conveyed the water 1,731 feet, and the cart only 951
feet. The superficial area watered by one load of the
van was 34,620 feet, and by the old system only
13,314 feet. When we consider the time that is lost
in travelling to and from the stand pipe, what a large
saving this represents in the cost of this work.</p>

<p>Mr. Tomkins, C.E., the surveyor of the important
Metropolitan parish of St. George, Hanover Square,
has made the following comparative experiments
with one of Bayley's vans as against an ordinary
cart:&mdash;</p>

<p>This shows a mean gain of 26 per cent. in favour
of the van, and the following tables made by an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
inspector in 1873, showing the actual occupation of
the ordinary carts and Bayley's vans during a day's
work, are extremely interesting, as showing that while
the van is engaged in spreading the water the time of
the cart is wasted in travelling to and from the stand
posts, and when it is borne in mind also that the van
spreads water more widely than the cart, there can
be no doubt that a saving of at least 30 per cent. can
be effected by the substitution of these vans for the
old-fashioned cart.</p>

<p>One of the earliest methods for watering streets,
but one which has, I think, almost entirely died out
on account principally of the large quantity of water
used in the process, was that of allowing the water to
run down the channel gutters, ponding it back by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
means of canvass or leather aprons placed across the
gutter, and then spreading the water on to the surface
of the street by throwing it with wooden shovels.</p>

<p>This method, although at first sight may appear
clumsy, is an exceedingly good one upon sanitary
grounds. It not only lays the dust, but it washes the
surface of the streets, and it most effectually scours
out the gutters and at the same time flushes the
sewers, which at the season that watering is
necessary is also of great importance to any town.
By this process a delightful freshness is given to the
air, and the appearance of the cool and limpid water
rushing along on each side of the street acts favorably
upon the inhabitants. The great objections to this
system are the enormous quantity of water that is
used in the process, and the difficulty of doing the
work after the traffic of the day has commenced.
Somewhat of a modification of this process is what
is known as "Brown's System of Street Watering,"
which may be described as follows:&mdash;A lead pipe is
laid in the footpath at the back of the kerb on each
side of the street to be watered, small gratings or
shields being fixed in the pipe at intervals of twelve
inches, and the remaining space filled with asphalte;
small holes are then bored in the pipe through the
openings in the shields. The pipe is connected with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the water main in the street, and is provided with the
necessary stopcocks, &amp;c.</p>

<p>On the water being turned on, fine jets are thrown
in different directions upon the surface of the street.</p>

<p>The width of roadway that can be watered by this
process depends upon the pressure of the water, but
it may be fairly assumed that in most towns streets
of fifty feet width could be effectually watered in a
few minutes by a pipe on each side of the street.</p>

<p>This process has not gained much favour hitherto,
principally on account of the large first cost involved,
which would amount to upwards of £800 per mile of
street, but the expense afterwards should not much
exceed the wages of one man at about 3s. 6d. per day
to manipulate the necessary work, and the interest on
the outlay and depreciation of the pipes, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The other objections to this system are:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1.) The liability of the pipes and perforations to
get out of order, especially when allowed to lie idle
for so many months in each year.</p>

<p>(2.) The unpleasantness to pedestrians which
must be caused whilst the watering is proceeding.</p>

<p>(3.) The inconvenience to the traffic during the
process.</p>

<p>(4.) The effect upon the water by high winds,
when in all probability it would be blown back across
the foot pavements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>(5.) In very broad streets it would be inoperative.</p>

<p>In Paris and other continental cities, and also in
several towns in this country, the watering is effected
by hose and reels, or by portable iron tubes.</p>

<p>Mr. Parry, C.E., the borough surveyor of Reading,
has given the following particulars of the system of
hand watering adopted in that borough, in which he
gives the cost, and describes the utility of that
method as compared with the use of water carts:&mdash;</p>

<p>A water cart (he states) will water twice a day a
superficial area of 23,849 yards, and for a length
watered one width that means 5,962 lineal yards, or
for a double width 2,981 yards, the cost per day of
laying on being as follows:&mdash;Horse, cart, and man,
8s.; cost of maintenance of cart, harness, shoeing,
&amp;c., 1s. 5d., making 9s. 5d. per day.</p>

<p>With respect to the hand machines he states that
he has one of Headley's drum machines, and three
of special make, somewhat similar to those used in
Paris. They are equal in point of work; and one
machine will water 23,740 square yards twice a day,
which, it will be observed, is very close to the amount
of work performed by a cart.</p>

<p>"Headley's machine cost us (he continues), five
years ago when new, £31 7s. 3d., and the repairs and
maintenance since that date have been £22, or an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
average of £4 8s. per annum, and is just now almost
past repair. The other description of hand machine
cost each when new £20, and the repairs and
maintenance have amounted to an average of
£3 18s. each year. They were in use sometime
before Headley's was obtained, and they will be of
use for a long time yet. The cost of labour per day
by the hand machines is for two men at 2s. 10d.
each&mdash;5s. 8d.&mdash;as it requires two men to work the
machine properly, one to distribute the water, and
the other to move the machine and to attach and
detach the apparatus to and from the hydrants; add
to this 7d. per day for maintenance and repairs, will
make 6s. 3d. per day. The quantity of water
delivered by the water carts is 0.51 gallon per square
yard, and by the hand machine 1.30 gallons."</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that in the case of the cart
24,324 gallons of water are used per diem, and 61,724
gallons by the hand machines, the surface watered
being very nearly the same in both cases. Assuming
that the water has a commercial value of 6d. per
1,000 gallons, and adding this to the cost per diem in
each case, the total cost stands thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="70%" summary="">

</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>the advantage in point of cost being in favour of the
carts, but the hand machine may water better,
especially in broad streets, although in narrow streets
or where there is much traffic, this method would be
impracticable.</p>

<p>In Paris both hose and carts are used for watering
the thoroughfares, the former for the boulevards, the
avenues, and a certain number of first-class streets.
The watering plant belongs to the municipality, and
they have various forms of carts, containing 220, 242
and 286 gallons respectively, and will water from
2,400 to 3,350 square yards. The watering by hose
is attended to by the ordinary street cleaners, who
can easily water 24,000 square yards in about thirty-five
minutes, deducting the time necessary to connect
the apparatus with the mains, but this requires a
gymnastic performance, which, if once seen, is not
easily forgotten.</p>

<p>Watering the streets with sea water should be
adopted whenever it is feasible, as it not only gives a
delightful freshness to the air and dispels iodine, but
it also causes the surface of the street to maintain its
humidity for a longer period than when fresh water is
used, as it impregnates the soil with hygrometric
matter.</p>

<p>This has been often attempted artificially, not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
by adding common salt to the water used for watering,
but also by adding chloride of calcium, notably in
Rouen, where this material is obtained from the
manufactories of pyroligenous acid in the neighbourhood.
It is stated that on a mile of road, 16 feet in
width, 5,630 gallons of water were necessary daily,
but that the same result was attained with 1,480
gallons of chloride solution, marking 30° Beaumé,
and costing about ½d. per gallon, the humectation
remaining good for five or six days with the solution
of chloride. With water only in 1,093 yards, in four
rounds daily, 3,520 gallons were used, the cost being
48s.; with chloride of calcium the cost was 32s.
per day.</p>

<p>Watering the roads with a largely diluted disinfectant,
such as "Sanitas" in the liquid form, is
frequently of great benefit, and where it can be
afforded, it should be occasionally done, especially in
the narrower streets and more crowded districts of a
city or town.</p>

CONTRACTS <em>V.</em> ADMINISTRATION BY LOCAL AUTHORITY.</h2>


<p>Amongst the questions which I addressed to the
surveyors of the principal towns of England was the
following:&mdash;"Is the house refuse collected by the
Sanitary Authority or by a Contractor?" and out of
the ninety towns from which I received replies, only
thirty were found to employ contractors for this
purpose, and of these the authorities of two of them
proposed to dispense with the services of the contractor,
and to administrate the work with their own
staff, as they found the existing state of things was
thoroughly unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>This is hardly to be wondered at when the nature
of such contracts comes to be considered. The
"dust" or "slopping" contractor, or whatever he
may be designated, can hardly be expected to be a
philanthropist, whose principal object in carrying
out his contract is that of benefiting his fellow
creatures and not himself; on the contrary, it may
fairly be assumed that the contractor's object is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
serve his own interests, and to make his contract
pay. It is but natural, although the result may not
be eminently satisfactory either to the ratepayers,
who require a careful and systematic cleansing of
their dustbins and streets, or to the Sanitary
Authority and their officers who have to look after
him. The officers, if they do their strict duty, will
probably be engaged in constant disputes and litigation
with the contractor as to the due and proper
observance of the terms of his contract, and the
consequence of their time being thus occupied instead
of in other more important matters, is naturally
detrimental to the interests of the ratepayers.</p>

<p>If we turn to the articles of agreement or contract
usually drawn up between a Sanitary Authority and
a contractor for scavenging, we find that they are
generally very binding in their phraseology, and enter
fully into the details of the work; they should state
very clearly the number of times in every week that
the contractor shall cause all the ashpits in the
districts enumerated to be emptied and cleansed, the
manner in which this work shall be performed, and
how the materials thus removed shall be disposed of
and the place of their ultimate destination. The
conditions should further specify what amount of
manual, team labour, and carts, are necessary for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
work, and also what plant the contractor must keep
in the way of ladders, baskets, shovels, and brooms,
&amp;c. The conditions should also contain a carefully
prepared list of the streets to be swept, and the
manner and number of times this work must be
executed, and arrange for the disposal of the materials
thus removed.</p>

<p>In many such contracts it is found necessary to
insert clauses binding the contractor under all sorts
of fearful penalties, to be always at the disposal and
under the commands of the inspector of nuisances,
or such other officer or officers as the Sanitary
Authority may appoint. The contractor's men also
are forbidden to refuse gratuities (an order which
they no doubt fully carry out?) and are directed on
no account to remove either trade or garden refuse,
and they are also enjoined to be "careful to consult
the convenience of the householders in their visits,
and to thoroughly clean up all dirt and litter that
they may cause in the discharge of their duties."
If they fail in any or either of these injunctions and
commands, or for any other dereliction of duty, the
inspector of nuisances, or such other officer as the
Sanitary Authority shall appoint, may summarily
dismiss them, without any reference being made on
the subject to their employer the contractor, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
fact the conditions have necessarily to be made so
stringent and binding as to be either totally inoperative
or open to grave abuses, or, on the other hand,
the work can be carelessly and improperly executed
by the contractor.</p>

<p>I am, therefore, strongly of opinion that the work
of the collection of house refuse and cleansing the
streets should be carried out by the Local Authority
with their own officers and staff, and that executing
this work by contract is a mistake and a false
economy. It is, perhaps, true that it may be done in
the latter manner at less actual cost to the ratepayers,
but all public work should be done in the
best manner possible, irrespective of cost, thoroughly,
but without extravagance, and the result of such
work, especially where it affects the cleanliness and
the appearance of a town, soon fully repays any
moderate extra cost that may thus have been incurred,
irrespective of the enormous benefit that is conferred
upon any community by the reduction of disease and
the death-rate by a proper attention to such necessary
sanitary work.</p>

"<em>£ s. d.</em>"</h2>


<p>A question of the greatest importance to the ratepayers,
and one in which they often take the most
lively interest, is that of the cost of maintaining the
necessary staff for the purpose of carrying out the
scavenging of the town, or for paying the contracts
for a similar work.</p>

<p>It is, of course, not possible to lay down any hard
and fast line as to the cost of scavenging in any city
or town, as it must necessarily vary considerably
according to circumstances; much depends upon
whether the district to be scavenged is an urban one,
consisting of houses closely packed together, or
whether it is suburban, with scattered villas and
mansions standing in their own grounds; the question,
also, of the distance of the depôts to which the
material has to be carted, considerably affects the
result of any estimate, as also does the cost of horse
hire, the rate of wages, and whether the district is of
a hilly or flat nature, and, as I have before shown,
the manner in which the streets are formed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
paved, the habits of the people, and last, but not
least, the manner of the eventual disposal of the
rubbish after removal; all these points must bear
with great weight upon any question of cost, and
make the results widely different.</p>

<p>On referring to the returns to which I have more
than once alluded, it is found that the cost of removing
the house refuse and cleansing and sweeping
the streets combined, varies considerably in different
localities, in one case the sum amounts only to the
rate of one half-penny per annum per head of the
population of the town, whereas in another case the
amount is at the rate of three shillings and sixpence
per head. On calculating the average cost per head
of population per annum of the ninety towns from
which I received replies on this point, I find that it
amounts to about tenpence half-penny, after giving
credit for any sum of money realised by the sale of
the refuse to farmers and others; so that if this
work is costing the ratepayers of a town or city anything
under a shilling per head of the whole population
every year they have no cause to grumble, as
they are so frequently found to do that their rates are
higher, and what they have to show for them less
than any other town in England.</p>

<p>I have discussed the question of "contracts" or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
"administration" in a former chapter, but there is
still another question which is also closely connected
and intermingled with the question of cost, and that
is when the Sanitary Authority carry out the collection
and removal of the house refuse and cleanse the
streets with their own staff, whether it is better and
more economical for them to keep their own stud of
horses or to hire them.</p>

<p>To do thorough justice to the work I am of opinion
that both the horses and carts should be the property
of the Sanitary Authority for the following reasons:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1.) The horses and their drivers should be under
the control of the town surveyor or superintendent,
in the same manner as the scavengers who accompany
the cart. This is not the case if the horses are
hired.</p>

<p>(2.) The carts can be started on their rounds and
leave work at such time as may be found most convenient,
and all the horses being kept in one stable
greatly facilitates this arrangement.</p>

<p>(3.) The horses hired for this kind of service are
frequently quite unfit to draw the bulky loads in the
lofty carts behind them, and opprobrium is thrown
upon the Sanitary Authority and the officials in
consequence.</p>

<p>(4.) Economy in working is secured, for not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
will good horses properly kept do a much better day's
work than bad ones ill kept, but there is no one
making a profit out of them as is the case when the
horses are hired.</p>

<p>With regard to the question as to the comparative
cost of scavenging where a stud of horses is kept and
where they are hired, the figures that I am about to
give can only be speculative, as the conditions of each
town are so widely different, but the figures may
serve as a guide for forming an estimate of the kind,
and they may be altered to suit the requirements of
any city or town.</p>

<p>I will, therefore, assume that a town with a population
of about 35,000 inhabitants will require at
least seven scavengers' carts constantly at work,
without reckoning those which will be required after
a fall of snow or in exceptionally muddy weather, and
for which purposes auxiliary horses and carts must
be hired, as also those which are engaged in hauling
stones and other materials used for roads or public
works.</p>

<p>I have already stated that the value of an ordinary
dust cart is about £18, so I will retain that figure for
my estimate.</p>

<p>The value of a new set of cart harness, including
a loin cloth, should not exceed £7.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>To work seven carts properly, eight horses will be
required, which may be estimated to cost about £50
each.</p>

<p>The first cost of the necessary stabling for eight
horses, including purchase of land, erection of buildings
with a foreman's house, corn and hay lofts
and machinery and tools, may be reckoned at about
£1,500.</p>

<p>With regard to the wages to be paid to the
scavengers and the carters, it may be reasonably
assumed that their rate of wages may be much lower
than that paid to navvies, or what are known as
"pick and shovel" men, for the following reasons:&mdash;</p>

<p>In all house refuse there is always present a
quantity of such materials as rags, bones, pieces of
iron, and other articles, which have a commercial
value, and behind each scavenger's cart hangs a
sack, into which all such articles are placed by the
men engaged in the removal of the house refuse, and
are subsequently sold, and the spoil divided between
them as perquisites. I have been credibly informed
that in some localities the amount thus realised
averages more than four shillings a week throughout
the year.</p>

<p>It is also a notable fact that although the householders
are most particularly requested not to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
gratuities to the men employed by the Sanitary
Authority in this work, yet a considerable number of
them constantly give the men a gratuity or bribe to
ensure the dustbin being regularly and properly
cleared, although the less generous, or poorer members
of the community probably suffer in consequence;
again at Christmas the scavenger feels himself
entitled to demand and receive a handsome present
in the form of a Christmas-box, which, in a rich
neighbourhood, amounts in the aggregate to no inconsiderable
sum.</p>

<p>For these reasons I put the wages both of the
scavenger and the carter at 16s. each per week, and
adding a guinea a week for the foreman, who has in
addition to this a house to live in rent free, and a
stableman at 18s. a week, the total expenses are
accounted for except those of the keep of the horses,
shoeing, veterinary attendance, lighting the stable, &amp;c.</p>

<p>This also is a sum very difficult to estimate, as
fodder, bedding, &amp;c., varies so widely in different
districts, but for the purposes of this calculation it
may be estimated that 17s. per horse per week should
be sufficient to cover all expenses under these heads.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this calculation it will be
necessary to assume that the £1,500 has been
borrowed at 4½ per cent. in perpetuity, although as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
matter of fact any monies borrowed for such a
purpose as this would probably carry a sinking fund,
so as to liberate the debt at the end of thirty or
perhaps fifty years, but if I were to reckon the
interest in this way in my estimate, it would complicate
it unnecessarily.</p>

<p>I have assumed that to meet the depreciation of
horse flesh it will be necessary to put aside the value
of one horse each year, without reckoning anything
per contra for the sale of those worn out or injured
in the work, as I think this will be found to be what
would be necessary.</p>

<p>I have allowed £50 per annum for repairs and
depreciation of the buildings and machinery, as I
consider this should be quite sufficient for a well-managed
and cared-for property.</p>

<p>I have allowed 15 per cent. per annum for repairs
and depreciation of the harness, and 12 per cent. for
the carts.</p>

<p>The estimate will consequently stand thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>This shows that the cost of hiring would be slightly
in excess of that of keeping a stud of horses, and
when we consider the unquestionable benefit to be
derived by adopting this method, I think most Urban
Authorities who are now hiring their team labour
would do well to consider the question of purchasing
and keeping their own stud.</p>

<p>Great care, however, would have to be exercised in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the supervision, or the expenditure would speedily
increase, as in all stable establishments without such
supervision, grave abuses, and even fraud, may go
undetected for a considerable period.</p>

<p>The figures that I have given in my estimates must
not be criticised, for they are not intended to fix the
value of such work, but simply to act as a guide to
anyone interested in making an estimate of the kind,
in which case prices more in accordance with the
district could be inserted.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
